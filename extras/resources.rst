Genomics
--------
- `RNA-seqlopedia <https://rnaseq.uoregon.edu/>`_, an overview of RNA-seq from experimental design through analysis steps.
- `"Learn Bioinformatics in 100 hours"
  <https://www.biostarhandbook.com/edu/course/1/>`_, an adaptation of the
  Applied Bioinformatics course from Penn State. **Costs $25** for the course
  and the Biostar Handbook. Well worth it if you're interested in learning
  bioinformatics further.
- `Ten simple rules for biologists learning to program
  <http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005871>`_,
  from PLOS Computational Biology
- `"Top N Reasons to do a PhD or post-doc in bioinformatics"
  <https://caseybergman.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/top-n-reasons-to-do-a-ph-d-or-post-doc-in-bioinformaticscomputational-biology/>`_,
  a blog post on why you would want to do this in the first place.
- `Applied Computational Genomics course
  <https://github.com/quinlan-lab/applied-computational-genomics>`_ from
  University of Utah, taught by Aaron Quinlan (author of BEDTools)
- The Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core has several fantastic modules: https://github.com/hbctraining/main.
- `Introduction to Computational Biology
  <https://biodatascience.github.io/compbio>`_, a course taught by Mike Love
  (author of DESeq2). Lots of great links in his reading list, as well.
